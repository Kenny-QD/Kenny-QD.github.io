/**
 * Loops
 * 
 * Loops are used to let us run a code block as many times as possible.
 * We use them to iterate over a collection of data.
 * Loops iterate infinitly, unless given a stopping condition, which stops the loop
 * once given condition has been reached.
 * 
 * There are 3 different types of loops we can use
 * 
 * While-Loops, For-loops, For-in-Loops.
 */
 
 
 /**
  * For-Loops:
  * Can be used to when we loop a certain amount of times
  * We can use them to iterate through a collection of data like
  * Arrays, Strings, etc.
  * 
  *    *Initial expression,
  *      *Stopping condition
  *        *Incrementor
  * 
  *  With an initial expression, we are starting the loops
  * 
  *  The stopping condition is when we want the loop to stop,
  *   failure to give a proper stopping condition will create an infinite loop.
  *    infinite loops can crash your system, if not given a proper condition
  *  
  *  Incrementors increases or decreases once the condition is satisfied and will
  *   continue the action until the stopping condition is met.
  *           
  *            [EXAMPLE]

 * We can loop over arrays, by using a For-Loop

/**
